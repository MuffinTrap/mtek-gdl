Prior to doing the following instructions, you must extract the 'mtek-gdl' folder from the downloaded archive
into your C:\ drive.

If you're having trouble setting up MTek-GDL, you can ask for help from the Wiibrew Forums right here:
http://forum.wiibrew.org/


To set up the Wii version of MTek-GDL:

    - This is assuming that you already have DevKitPPC already set up and ready to use. If you haven't yet, get
      it from this website: http://devkitpro.org/
      When installing, have everything unchecked but have Minimal System, devkitPPC and Programmer's Notepad as
      those are all you need to develop software for the Nintendo Wii. Complete the installation and make sure
      that all packages were downloaded and installed successfully (no download/extraction errors).

    - Since Programmer's Notepad is a bit clunky, it is recommended to use CodeBlocks as your main IDE which you
      can get here: http://www.codeblocks.org/
      Once installed, apply the included user templates from the included 'codeblocks templates' folder into
      your CodeBlocks application data folder. Installing the templates are detailed within the readme file
      inside the templates folder.

    - If for some reason you prefer to use Programmer's Notepad, you may want to download the latest version of
      it here as well: http://www.pnotepad.org/
      Pick the portable version and simply copy the program files over the existing one but make sure you backup
      'UserTools.xml' inside the settings folder as that contains pre-configured hotkeys for compiling and running
      your programs through a makefile.

    - Install the MTek-GDL Wii library and its dependencies by running install.bat inside the mtek-gdl folder then
      follow the on-screen instructions.

    - Once the dependencies and the library itself have been compiled and installed, open the project file of any
      of the included Wii examples with Programmer's Notepad (can either be the old included version or the most
      recent version) and try to compile to see whether or not the library and its dependencies were installed
      properly.

    - To be able to run Wii programs on your Wii directly from your PC, you must set a WIILOAD environment variable
      with the IP address of your Wii as its value so you can use wiiload to upload and run your programs into your
      console.

    To add/modify environment variables in Windows:

        - Head to System Properties by either pressing Winkey + Break or right click My Computer and click Properties.
          In Windows Vista and onwards, click on Advanced System Settings at the left of the System window.

        - Click on the Advanced tab then click the Environment Variables button.

        - In the User Variables list, click on New then enter WIILOAD as the Variable name and tcp:x.x.x.x where
          x.x.x.x is the IP address of your Wii (determine it in the Homebrew Channel by pressing the Home button on
          your Wiimote) as the Variable value.

          For convenience reasons, you may want to reserve a specific IP address for your Wii through your router
          settings so that you don't have to change the WIILOAD variable every time your Wii is given a different
          IP address. However, this won't be covered in this document but you can Google around for instructions on
          how to do it.

    - If you managed to compile and run one of the included examples with no problem, have fun!


To create a PC or Wii project with MTek-GDL (CodeBlocks method, most recommended):

    - This is much simpler than the Programmer's Notepad or makefile method as the included templates for CodeBlocks
      has pretty much everything set for you. Just simply click Create a New Project in the start-up screen, head to
      the User Templates list and select the project you'd like to make.

    - If you created a Wii project with a name other than the one specified by default, you'll need to bring up the
      Build Options dialog then click Ok to fix an incorrect PROJECT_NAME bug with CodeBlocks when you try to compile
      and run your project.

    - If your dealing with cross-platform projects, you may want to take into account the presence of the PLATFORM_PC
      or PLATFORM_WII macros so your code can know which target platform it is being compiled for.


To create a Wii project with MTek-GDL (old Programmer's Notepad or makefile method, probably outdated):

    - If you wish to create a new project with Programmer's Notepad (or anything that uses makefiles),
      simply copy the files inside '/mtek-gdl/examples/wii/template' to your new project's folder and
      create your Programmer's Notepad project and main.cpp files inside it as well but make sure that
      the path to your project folder does not contain any spaces as it is a limitation with most
      versions of make.

    - In your main.cpp file, add the following line at the top of it:
      #include <mgdl-wii.cpp>
      And simply write your additional header files right after it (such as wpad.h).
