Updated instructions for CodeBlocks 20.03 in Windows 10 
by muffintrap.

Read the Readme.txt file first. This file has more detailed instructions that are in addition to those in that file.

0. Environment variables.

To make it easier to use the template, add DEVKITPRO to your path in Windows / Linux 

Windows 10:
Type "Environment variable" into Windows search
Open "Edit the system environment variables"
Select "Advanced" Tab
Press "Environment Variables..." on the bottom right
Select "New..." under "User variables for ..."
Input:
	Variable name: DEVKITPRO
	Variable value: path to devkitPro/ folder 

Note that MSYS2 and the compiler expect paths with forward slashes.
So if your devkitPro/ is for example in:
D:\Dev\Wii\devkitPro
then you need to make the environment variable:
/d/Dev/Wii/devkitPro

You can now use the variable by surrounding it with percentage marks, like this
%DEVKITPRO%\...

If you use the Dolphin emulator, it is a good idea to add it too so that you can launch your build in Dolphin from CodeBlocks:

Follow the above steps again, but instead of creating a new variable, select the "Path" and click "Edit..."

In the Edit environment variable window, click on "New" and then "Browse"
Navigate to the Dolphin installation directory, select the directory that has the Dolphin.exe in it.

Click "OK", and "OK"


1. Adding the compiler to Codeblocks

template-win/share/codeblocks/compilers/options_devkit...

This file adds a new compiler configuration to Codeblocks
Add it to %APPDATA%/CodeBlocks/share/codeblocks/compilers/

The compiler should now appear in the list. Go to 
Settings -> Compiler Settings / Global compiler settings / Selected compiler:

Check that the compiler directory is correct
Set the compiler as default if you just use CodeBlocks for Wii projects.


2. Project templates

Place the UserTemplates/DevkitPPC-Wii Project with MTek-GDL to %APPDATA%/codeblocks/UserTemplates


3. Finding the CB Share program, that updates CodeBlocks configs

If you don't have the CB Share Config program, you need to reinstall Codeblocks and select to install it.

In windows it is called cb_share_config.exe


4. Starting a new project

Open CodeBlocks
Select "Create a new project"
In the "New from template" dialog:
select User templates from the left side
Select DevkitPPC-Wii Project with MTek-GDL

5. Checking the build options

When the project is created, you should have a window on the left side of CodeBlocks window, with tabs: Projects/Files/Symbols/Resources

In Projects tab you should have
Workspace
- <project name>
  - Sources/
    - main.cpp
	
Right click on the <project name>, select Build Options...
In the Project build options window, the Release config is selected.
Select <project name> above it to access global build settings for the project.
Select the Pre/post build steps tab.
In the Post-build steps text field you have. 
"wiiload $(PROJECT_NAME).dol"

Remove this if you don't want to send the build to Wii every time.

Change it to 
"Dolphin $(PROJECT_NAME).dol" to run it in Dolphin.

6. MY EYES!

CodeBlocks does not have any dark themes and only the editor theme can be changed.
Here is a link to the dark Dracula theme: https://draculatheme.com/codeblocks

CodeBlocks default UI is very cluttered. The Extra tools can be hidden by right clicking them and deselecting.
