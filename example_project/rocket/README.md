### Rocket library

(Original library)[https://github.com/rocket/rocket]

This is a modified version of the rocket library
that can write tracks to a header and cpp files and to a json file

When developing the project you connect to the editor
and adjust the values.
If the connection fails, the tracks are read from header or json
