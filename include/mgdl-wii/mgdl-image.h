//! Saves a screenshot.
/*!
 *	\details Saves a screenshot and saves it as a 24-bit PNG image with maximum compression. Because of that,
 *		encoding the image will take about roughly half a second.
 *
 *	\note As of v0.80 and onwards, this function can be called anywhere but the actual screen capture will
 *		take place once gdl::Display() is called. This is so that the screenshot will always be the same as
 *		what is seen on the TV and it also allows taking screenshots while in anti-aliased mode.
 *	\note When taking a screenshot while in anamorphic widescreen mode, the image will not be stretched
 *		horizontally for correct aspect ratio so it had to be manually stretched with an image editing program.
 *
 *	\param[in]	fileName	File name (may contain a path) of the output image file (must end with .png).

 *
 *	\note It is not advisable to use this class for handling several individual sprite images. Instead, Use
 *		the gdl::SpriteSet class.

	 *	\details Loads an image file, internally creates texture and image buffers and then converts the image data into a
	 *		texture. This version of the library only supports PNG image files that are in grayscale, 8-bit palletized, RGB,
	 *		and RGBA color formats as well as TPL texture files containing a single texture. There will be no support for
	 *		interlaced PNG images.
	 *
	 *      It is advisable that you use an appropriate texture format if you wish to save as much MEM1 memory as possible
	 *		such as using gdl::RGB5A3 for images that have simple transparency (like pixel art sprites) and gdl::RGB565 for
	 *		images that have no alpha channel. Using such texture formats may result in slight color quality loss however so
	 *		use it in situations where color definition is not so important.
	 *
	 *	\note When a TPL texture file is being loaded, the filterMode and format parameters are ignored.
	 *	\note This function will allocate temporary buffers used for converting the image data into an appropriate texture
	 *		format. These buffers are allocated in MEM2 using malloc2() to reduce memory fragmentation in MEM1 when loading
	 *		a lot of individual images with varying resolutions.
	 *
	 *	\param[in]	fileName	File name of image file to load.
	 *	\param[in]	filterMode	Image filter mode (see gdl::TextureFilterModes).
	 *	\param[in]	format		Texture format (see gdl::TextureFormatModes).
	 *
	 *	\returns Non-zero if the image was successfully loaded otherwise an error occurred.

     *      With mipmapped images, aliasing issues will be eliminated when you scale down an image from its original
     *		resolution. Since mipmapped images take up a bit more memory than a non-mipmapped image, use it wisely for
     *		graphics that scale down tremendously or textures of environments.
     *
     *  \note Unlike gdl::Image::LoadImage(), this function will take slightly longer to load an image and takes up more
     *		MEM2 memory temporarily due to on-the-fly mipmap generation.
