	/*!
	 *	\details Unlike gdl::Texture::Create(), this function creates a mipmapped texture buffer which improves
	 *		rendering quality (and in some cases performance) when the texture is drawn smaller than its original
	 *		resolution. It is recommended to use mipmapped textures for large 3D geometry or images	that get scaled
	 *		up or down immensely and you don't want it to look all jagged and pixelated when it gets small enough.
	 *
	 *	\note Unlike non-mipmapped textures which can be of any size as long as its a multiple of 4x4 pixels,
	 *		mipmapped textures however must be a power of two to work correctly.
	 *  \note Mipmapped textures take up roughly 33% more memory (with 9 mipmap levels) than that of a non mipmapped
	 *		texture so you must determine the number of mipmaps necessary to generate such as if the image doesn't get
	 *		downscaled so much, a single mipmap level is good enough for it. Using texture formats that are of a lower
	 *		color depth such as gdl::RGB565 or gdl::RGB5A3 will help as well with a slight loss of color definition.
	 *	\note The smallest mipmap resolution the library will allow is 4x4 pixels (same size as a texture block) so a
	 *		maximum of 9 mipmaps can be generated from a 1024x1024 texture image. If the texture is too small to reach
	 *		the specified number of maximum mipmaps, it will simply generate less mipmaps than that specified.
	 *  \note By default, mipmaped textures are set to have an anisotropy level of 4 and edge LOD computation enabled
	 *		for the best (but most intensive) mipmapping quality. You can change these using GX commands and the
	 *		gdl::Texture::TexObj() function to retrieve the GXTexObj struct of the texture.
