 *
 *	\attention This is a work-in-progress "sneak-peek" version of this library! Avoid using functions that are not documented
 *	yet as they have not yet been finalized.
 *
 *	\section introSectionn Introduction
 *  MTek-GDL Wii is an open-source game development library designed to make homebrew game and application development for the
 *	Nintendo Wii a lot easier to do for both beginner and intermediate programmers. This library supports GX accelerated 2D
 *	graphics routines, sound playback, ogg vorbis streaming and image loading and texture conversion routines.
 *
 *  Despite this library mostly supporting 2D graphics only, the way how this library is written allows one to be able to use
 *	MTek-GDL as a base for developing custom 2D or 3D graphics engines provided that they know how to write their own GX
 *	graphics routines and knowing enough how to make a decent game engine in general.
 *
 *	\section changeLog Changes since v0.66:
 *	- Fixed a bug in oggplayer library where oggplayer.h didn't include ivorbisfile.h which is needed for a certain function
 *	  declaration in the header.
 *
 *	- Removed PutX() functions in both gdl::Image and gdl::SpriteSet classes in place of the improved gdl::Image::Put() and
 *	  gdl::SpriteSet::Put() functions which now has optional parameters for pivot point, rotation angle and scale factor.
 *
 *	- Changed syntax of gdl::InitSystem() function significantly.
 *
 *	- Added multisample anti-aliasing support but only works in hi-res mode.
 *
 *	- Optimized gdl::Display() routine which now performs a EFB to XFB copy prior to GX_DrawDone() to prevent potential
 *	  frame dropping when the framerate drops.
 *
 *	- Removed letterboxed aspect ratio mode, it was pretty buggy and problematic and is much better to implement it yourself
 *	  in the long run.
 *
 *	- Fixed argument order of gdl::Image::LoadImageMipmapped() to match with gdl::Image::CreateMipmapped().
 *
 *	- gdl::SaveScreen() can now take screenshots in anti-aliased modes. The function also now works by setting a
 *	  screen capture request to the main library which is then processed by gdl::Display() when called so that the
 *	  finished scene will always be captured correctly.
 *
 *	- Added gdl::wii::CPUdelta and gdl::wii::GPUdelta global variables for profiling/benchmarking purposes.
 *
 *	- Made gdl::wii::LowResolutionMode, gdl::wii::ProgressiveMode and gdl::wii::WidescreenMode into
 *	  gdl::wii::IsLowResMode(), gdl::wii::IsProgressive() and gdl::wii::IsWidescreen() functions respectively.
 *
 *	- Made gdl::SpriteSet::SpriteInfo() return a const pointer to prevent accidental modification.
 *
 *	- Fixed a bunch of typos and spelling mistakes in the documentation.

//! Initializes the system.
/*!
 *	\details This function must be called before using most library functions (usually graphics drawing and sound related). What this
 *      function does is that it initializes the system's video, graphics, and audio subsystems as well as automatically setting up
 *      anamorphic widescreen and progressive scan based on the system's configuration by default.
 *
 *	\note Even though this function initializes most of the important console subsystems, it does not initialize the file and Wiimote
 *      subsystems but they are pretty easy to initialize them yourself anyway (see the included Wii examples).
 *	\note When low-resolution mode is set, the video mode is set to non-interlaced (like a VC title) when the console is set to Standard
 *		480i mode. If a component video cable is used but the console is not set to progressive scan mode, interlacing is enabled by default for
 *		compatibility with HDTVs that may not support non-interlaced video through component. If progressive scan mode is set, low-resolution
 *		is emulated in which the library allocates a full 480/528 line framebuffer but drawing is allowed only at the top-half of it. When
 *		gdl::Display() is called, the top half is expanded vertically to fill the entire framebuffer.
 *	\note When anti-aliased mode is set, the actual screen resolution is reduced vertically by (y/2)-4 to make way for multi-sample
 *		anti-aliasing in the EFB and it also makes pixels of textures look like they were rendered at half the vertical resolution as
 *		MSAA is only done on the edges of polygons. Color depth and z-buffer are also reduced to 16-bit as well (RGB565 Z16 to be exact).

 *      variable gdl::ConsoleActive to tell whether or not console mode is set or not. Since v0.65 and onwards of this library, this
 *		function will allocate its own framebuffer and rmode settings so that the console screen will always be hi-res even when low-res

 *
