 *	\details Depending on the video mode and resolution, the screen resolution values may not tell the actual
 *	resolution that the console is running on. One such example is running in widescreen mode where gdl::ScreenXres
 *	would read 854 when the actual resolution is 640 due to the Wii not capable of handling a wide framebuffer and
 *	instead, widescreen is achieved through anamorphic means through the projection matrix.
 *
 *  In 4:3 or low-res mode, gdl::ScreenXres reads the true horizontal resolution.
 *
 *	To get the exact framebuffer resolution regardless of video mode, use the gdl::wii::rmode object.
